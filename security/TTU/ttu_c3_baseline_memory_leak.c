/*  Benchmark: Memory Leak Simulation
 *  @author  : Mert Side for TTU
 *  @brief   : To demonstrate a memory leak in C, you can create a scenario 
 *             where dynamically allocated memory is not properly released back 
 *             to the system, causing the application to consume increasing 
 *             amounts of memory over time. This can lead to system resource 
 *             exhaustion and potential failure or slowdown of the system.
 * 
 * Explanation of the Code
 * - Function create_memory_leak():
 *    This function allocates 1 KB of memory using malloc and does not release 
 *    it (i.e., it does not call free()). This results in memory being allocated 
 *    but never reclaimed.
 *    Optionally, the function writes to the allocated memory to simulate 
 *    working with data, which is a typical use case in applications.
 * - Repeated Leaks:
 *    The main() function calls create_memory_leak() repeatedly in a loop 
 *    (1000 times in this example), causing the program to leak significant 
 *    amounts of memory. It prints a message every 100 iterations to indicate 
 *    ongoing leaking.
 * - Resource Monitoring:
 *    After the loop, a message prompts to check the systemâ€™s resource monitor 
 *    to observe the impact of the memory leak on system resources.
 *
