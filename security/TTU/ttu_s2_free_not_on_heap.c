/*
 * Based on Free of Buffer not on Heap by STAM
 * Adapted by Mert Side for Texas Tech University
 *
 * Key Notes:
 * This program attempts to free memory that was not dynamically allocated on 
 *   the heap, here as memory allocated on the stack (alternatively this could 
 *   be in a static/global area). This can lead to undefined behavior, including 
 *   crashes or memory corruption, because the system's memory management 
 *   expects free to only be used on heap-allocated memory.
