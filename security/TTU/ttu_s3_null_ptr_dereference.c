/*
 * Based on Null Pointer Dereference not on Heap by STAM
 * Adapted by Mert Side for Texas Tech University
 *
 * Key Notes:
 *   This code creates a set of threads where each thread performs a specific 
 *     operation based on its PE ID. Specifically, one thread (PE 0) prints the 
 *     hexadecimal characters of a known string, while another thread (PE 1) 
 *     attempts to dereference a NULL pointer.
 * 
 * Understanding the Error "Illegal instruction (core dumped)" on Morello:
 *   "Illegal instruction (core dumped)":
 *     On platforms like Morello (which implements the CHERI capability model), 
 *     dereferencing a NULL pointer is considered an illegal operation because 
 *     NULL is not a valid memory address. When the CPU tries to execute this 
 *     operation, it triggers an exception, leading to the "Illegal instruction" 
 *     error and the program being terminated (core dumped).
 *   CHERI and Morello:
 *      On CHERI-enabled architectures like Morello, pointers are capabilities 
 *      that include metadata like bounds and permissions. When bad_ptr is set 
 *      to NULL, it becomes a capability with no valid bounds or permissions. 
 *      Trying to dereference it results in an exception because it violates 
 *      the safety guarantees enforced by the CHERI architecture.
