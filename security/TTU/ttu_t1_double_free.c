/*
 * Based on Double Free by STAM
 * Adapted by Mert Side for Texas Tech University
 *
 * Key Notes:
 * 
 * The code creates a shared resource that includes dynamically allocated memory
 *  and a mutex for synchronization. Each thread attempts to free the shared 
 *  memory. The mutex ensures that only one thread can access the shared memory 
 *  at a time, and setting the pointer to NULL after freeing it helps prevent 
 *  the second thread from attempting a double-free.
