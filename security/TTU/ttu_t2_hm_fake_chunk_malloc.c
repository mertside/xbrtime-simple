/*  Benchmark: Heap Manipulation
 *  @author  : Adapted by Mert Side for Texas Tech University
 *    
 * This vulnerability demonstrates a heap allocation exploit. It involves freeing   
 * chunks onto the tcache and then performing a use-after-free to modify chunk address.
 * Thus, a chunk is artificially added to the tcache and can be allocated during a malloc
