/*  Benchmark: use-after-reallocation
 *  @author  : Mert Side for TTU
 *  @brief   : A use-after-reallocation vulnerability occurs when memory that 
 *             was freed and then reallocated for another purpose is still 
 *             being accessed using a pointer that references the old data. 
 *             This can lead to undefined behavior, data corruption, or 
 *             security exploits.

/*
 * Changes in This Version after Mishels Comments on August 24th:
 *   
 *  Focus on Temporal Safety: The memory allocated for new_ptr has the same 
 *      size as original_ptr. If the allocator reuses the same memory block, 
 *      the test would trigger a use-after-reallocation issue when original_ptr 
 *      is accessed after being freed.
 *   
 *  No Out-of-Bounds Access: The previous out-of-bounds write was removed. 
 *      This revision now focuses purely on temporal safety without introducing 
 *      spatial safety violations.
 *   
 *   Checking for Address Reuse: A check is added to see if the allocator reuses 
 *      the same memory address for both original_ptr and new_ptr. If this 
 *      happens, it highlights the temporal safety issue.
 *
