/*  
 * Benchmark: Heap Manipulation
 *
 * This vulnerability demonstrates a heap manipulation exploit. It involves 
 * first using an out of bounds write to make the range of one chunk extend 
 * past the range of a formally subsequent chunk. Thus the memory range of the 
 * second chunk would be inside the range of the first. These chunks are then 
 * feed and reallocated. Thus any edit made on the larger chunk would be legal, 
 * regardless of whether the memory written to or read from was within the space 
 * of the smaller chunk.
